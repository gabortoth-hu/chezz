# Chezz

Just Another Chess Engine. What's more (or less...) not even an extraordinary?
People try to write the shortest chess engine, others to create
stronger and stronger engines. I am trying to keep it extremely simple and understandable.

It's just a case study, or 'fun' in another words. Enjoy!
